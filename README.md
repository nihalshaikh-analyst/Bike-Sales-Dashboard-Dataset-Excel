# Bike-Sales-Dashboard-Dataset-Excel
Bike Sales Dataset creating Dashboard by using  Excel. Project in the form of Sales Dashboard for a Bike Company.


## Bike Sales Dashboard

## Project Description
In this project, I have analysed a bike company's data to understand different factors that are considered by the customers before making a purchase decision. The final output of this project is a dashboard which provides a comprehensive overview of bike sales data, allowing stakeholders to analyse trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.


## Data Cleaning and Transformation
This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.
1.	Removing duplicates, unwanted cells and irrelevant columns.
2.	Replacing values with more meaningful entries  using FIND and REPLACE functions.
eg: M with Married in the "MaritalStatus" column,
    F with Female in the "Gender" column
  	etc
3.	Changing the data type of "Income" column to currency.
4.	Creating a conditional column based on the "Age" column to make out 3 different age brackets.using NESTED IF function.

## Data Analysis
Five pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between Bike Purchase and other factors such as Average Income, commute distance, Profession Home ownership and age.

## Data Visualization
Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and  customizing the pivot charts of corresponding  pivot table.
For user friendly and interactive experience  3 "Slicers" were added.

## Insights
From the analysis, we get to know the following information about bike purchasers:
- Both Male and female with higher average income in their respective category were more likely to purchase bike.
- The majority of bike purchasers were in the 31-54 year age bracket i.e the Middle Age group.
- People with a 0-1 MILE COMUTE WERE MOST LIKELY TO PURCHASE a bike FOLOWED BY  2-5 mile. 
- People with a 5+ mile commute were more likely not to purchase a bike.
- Homeowners were more likely to purchase bike.
- Professionals formed  the majority of the bike customers.

## Recommendations based on the Analysis
- Middle Age Group (31-54) shows the highest number of purchases. The management should ensure that it should target this segmen of population.
- An inverse linear relationship indicates that as the commuters' distance increases, they prefer other means of transportation other than bike riding so the company should focus on short distance commuters.
- Homewoners are much more likely to respond to offers and discounts so they must be focused.
